Recommender systems are extensively employed to suggest items that users are likely to appreciate. Broadly, there are three main types of recommender systems: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid systems.

Collaborative Filtering: Operates on the principle that if two users have historically liked the same items, then a new item liked by one user is likely to be liked by the other. Its key advantage lies in not requiring the system to understand or process item content.


Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items similar to those a user already likes by analyzing item descriptions.


Hybrid Recommender Systems: Combines collaborative and content-based methods, either via a unified algorithm or by blending the outputs of both methods. Research indicates that hybrid systems often yield superior recommendations compared to using any single approach.
Data Types:

Explicit Data: Reviews or ratings provided directly by users.
Implicit Data: User behavior and events, such as order history, search logs, and clicks. Implicit data is more challenging to process due to the difficulty of discerning relevant information but is easier to acquire.
Project Objective:
The project aims to develop a robust game recommender system by leveraging user preferences and gaming habits. Multiple algorithms, including two collaborative filtering and one content-based method, are implemented to facilitate comparative analysis, enabling the identification of the most effective recommendation algorithm. Advanced clustering techniques are employed to enhance segmentation and improve recommendation relevance.
